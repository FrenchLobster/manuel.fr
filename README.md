My Docusaurus Project
This is a GitHub project that explains how to create a Docusaurus project and set up an artificial intelligence tool on your Mac with Ollama.

What is Docusaurus?
Docusaurus is a static site generator that uses React, a JavaScript library, to create documentation, blog, product, and other types of websites. Docusaurus provides features such as i18n, search, custom themes, etchttps://code-garage.fr/blog/le-guide-simplifie-sur-la-syntaxe-markdown.

What is Ollama?
Ollama is a software that allows you to load and run artificial intelligence models such as Llama 2 and Code Llama on your Mac. Ollama exposes a webservice that can be queried by HTTP requestshttps://products.groupdocs.app/translation/fr/markdown.

How to create a Docusaurus project?
To create a Docusaurus project, you need to have Node.js installed on your Mac. Then, you can use the following commands to create and start a Docusaurus project:

# Create a new Docusaurus project
npx create-docusaurus@latest my-website classic

# Enter the project directory
cd my-website

# Start the development server
npx docusaurus start

This will create a new Docusaurus project in the my-website folder and start a development server on http://localhost:3000. You can edit the files in the docs and blog folders to add your content. You can also customize the docusaurus.config.js and src files to change the appearance and behavior of your website.

For more details, you can read the Docusaurus documentationhttps://code-garage.fr/blog/le-guide-simplifie-sur-la-syntaxe-markdown.

How to set up an artificial intelligence tool with Ollama?
To set up an artificial intelligence tool with Ollama, you need to download and install Ollama on your Mac. Then, you can use the following commands to download and run an artificial intelligence model:

# Download a model, such as Llama 2
ollama pull llama2

# Start the model as a webservice on port 11434
ollama serve llama2

This will download the Llama 2 model and start a webservice on http://localhost:11434. You can query the model by sending HTTP requests to the webservice, such as:

# Query the model with a prompt
curl -X POST http://localhost:11434/api/generate -d '{
"model": "llama2",
"prompt": "tell me a joke"
}'

This will return a response from the model, such as:

{
"response": "What do you call a fish that wears a bowtie? Sofishticated."
}

You can also use other models, such as Code Llama, to answer technical questions about programming. You can find more models and instructions on the Ollama websitehttps://products.groupdocs.app/translation/fr/markdown.

How to deploy your Docusaurus project?
To deploy your Docusaurus project, you need to have a GitHub account and a repository for your project. Then, you can use the following commands to push your project to GitHub:

# Initialize a git repository
git init

# Add your files to the repository
git add .

# Commit your changes
git commit -m "Initial commit"

# Set the remote origin to your GitHub repository
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git

# Push your changes to GitHub
git push -u origin main

This will upload your project to GitHub. You can then use GitHub Pages to host your website for free. You need to create a workflow file in the .github/workflows folder of your project, such as:

name: Deploy website

on:
push:
branches: [main]

jobs:
build-and-deploy:
runs-on: ubuntu-latest

steps:
•  name: Checkout

uses: actions/checkout@v2

•  name: Install dependencies

run: npm install

•  name: Build website

run: npm run build

•  name: Deploy website

uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
with:
github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
publish_dir: ./build

This will create a workflow that will build and deploy your website to GitHub Pages every time you push changes to the main branch. You need to enable GitHub Pages in your repository settings and select the gh-pages branch as the source.

For more details, you can read the Docusaurus deployment guidehttps://products.groupdocs.app/translation/fr/markdown/french-english.

Conclusion
This is a brief overview of how to create a Docusaurus project and set up an artificial intelligence tool on your Mac with Ollama. You can explore more features and possibilities with these tools and create amazing websites and applications.
