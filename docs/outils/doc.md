How does it work?
After subscribing to our services by signing a so-called order form, we will create your user interface (website) and give access to MenuChic Manager applications. This application will allow you to manage all the features and functionalities you have chosen in the order form.

When you sign the order form, you agree to follow the Rules and Policies for using MenuChic's services. This document explains everything you need to know about the technical and legal aspects of the service.

Why and to whom is this user guide?
This user guide is for anyone who wants to use the MenuChic Manager application. This might include business owners, managers, or employees in the food and catering industry who want to improve their operations and efficiency. The guide provides step-by-step instructions on downloading, installing, and using the app.

Read before starting
This user guide is comprehensive and covers all the functions, features and capabilities that our solution can offer so far.

The functions, features and capabilities that you can access depend on your specific needs and how they are configured in the Back Office. So, if you don't see some of the functions, features and capabilities described in this user guide, it's because

● You chose not to use them. We're always happy to advise you, but we also respect your decision. For instance, we might suggest using our takeaway feature to boost your sales, but you might not want it.

● Your business doesn't require them. For example, there's no point in having a table reservation feature if you run a food truck.

● They're still in development. We're constantly working to improve our services. You might notice some fields related to our upcoming functions, features and capabilities. These are not yet operational but are included to give you a sneak peek of what's coming next. We appreciate your patience and support while we finish these updates.

In the burger menu, you have a list of otpiron, the first menu point is the “settings”. Click on it.

Texte alternatif

Through the settings, you have a list of features and functionalities that you can set up one by one. On the above-screenshot, you can see this list of features. In the following we shall describe their settings one by one.

Business
In the "Business" section of the burger menu, you can manage and switch between your different businesses if you own more than one. This is particularly useful if you operate multiple restaurants or other types of businesses and you want to manage them all from the same account.

Texte alternatif

To switch between businesses, simply click on the business tab and select the business you want to manage. The interface will update to reflect the selected business, allowing you to manage its settings, view its performance, and carry out any other necessary tasks.

Remember, this menu item only appears if you have more than one business registered on the platform. If you only have one business, you won't see this option.

Texte alternatif

Your information
When you want to edit your company information, you can find everything you need under the "Business" tab. Just click on "Your Information".

Texte alternatif

You'll see a page with fields for your company name, address, and phone number, among other things. Feel free to make any updates you need to these fields.

Texte alternatif

You'll also notice options for displaying different icons on your website. These icons represent things like payment methods, culinary specialties, services, and activities. If you want these to show up on your website's information page, just activate the toggle next to each icon. If you don't want them to show, simply deactivate the toggle. These will show up on the “Information” page of your website.

Texte alternatif

⚠ There are a couple of features on this page that aren't quite ready for prime time. The “heading image” and "get my position" functions are still being developed, so you can just ignore these for now.

Texte alternatif

Texte alternatif

Reviews and Comments
You can incorporate social media links to your restaurant's website via the "Reviews and Comments" section. These links will appear in the footer of your website, providing a seamless way for your customers to connect with your restaurant's social media profiles. Facebook redirection icon can also be included in the website header next to the burger menu, making it easily accessible to your website visitors.

Texte alternatif

Here's how to do it:

1.Locate the specific field for each social media platform (such as Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, etc.).

2.Copy and paste your restaurant's social media URL into the corresponding field.

3.Make sure to activate the toggle located below each link to enable visibility on your website.

Texte alternatif

After you have added all your social media links, scroll down to the bottom of the page and click the "Send" button to save your changes.

Texte alternatif

Once you've completed these steps, verify that the links are appearing correctly in the footer of your restaurant's website. This feature allows your customers to engage with your brand on various social media platforms directly from your website, helping to enhance your online presence and brand awareness.

Texte alternatif

Click & Collect
The "Click & Collect" section provides key features to manage your restaurant's pickup orders effectively.

Texte alternatif

This feature helps in ensuring a smooth operation of your restaurant's Click & Collect service, providing a great pickup experience for your customers while effectively managing the workload of your staff.

Texte alternatif

There are three essential parameters in this section, as we shall explain.

Texte alternatif

Minimum (minutes) to complete order: This setting indicates the time required for preparing dishes. For instance, if the preparation time is set to 20 minutes, the first available pickup time offered to your customers will be at least 20 minutes after they place the order. This gives your kitchen staff sufficient time to prepare the food.

⚠ The “Minimum (minutes) to complete the order” and the “Maximum baskets per time slot” will remain in force until the next change. No automatic reset will apply.

Texte alternatif

Maximum baskets per time slot: While the length of the pickup time slot is set in the Back Office, as a restaurant owner, you can control the maximum number of order baskets that can be prepared and served during each time slot. For instance, if a time slot lasts for 15 minutes, and you have set the maximum number of order baskets at 10, your kitchen staff will need to prepare and serve up to 10 orders within each 15-minute slot.

Texte alternatif

Block orders until : in case the restaurant staff gets overwhelmed or if you need to suspend the Click & Collect service for any other reason, you can do so. Just drag the button to the hour and minute until which you want to suspend the service.

⚠ Any changes to “Block orders” will be used until the next time slot opens, at which point the original settings will be restored.

Tableside Ordering
The Tableside ordering parameters are general parameters which have an impact on the whole system. In other words, if the restaurant owner changes one or other of them, they will be taken into consideration until the next settings are made. That is why it is important to not forget to set it back to the initial parameters, if the restaurant owner wants to make modifications only for one specific day.

Texte alternatif

Texte alternatif

The features included in this section are:

Waiter Inquiry: This feature, when activated, displays a button on the restaurant customer's mobile phone after they are ordering a dish from the menu. If the customer has a question, they can press this button to call for a waiter. Tableside Ordering : With this feature, the restaurant owner can enable or disable tableside ordering for various reasons. For example, this could be useful during peak hours when you want to manage the flow of orders better. Order Notification : The third feature allows the restaurant owner to receive a notification for each tableside order. This can help keep track of orders as they come in and ensure no order goes unnoticed.

The combination of these features in the "Tableside Ordering" section allows for better management and control over the tableside ordering process, improving the overall dining experience for customers and enhancing the restaurant's operations.

Reservations
In the "Reservations" section, the restaurant owner can manage different parameters related to area settings and opening hours. This allows for efficient reservation management and optimal utilization of the restaurant's space.

Texte alternatif

Texte alternatif

Settings

Texte alternatif

In the screenshot above, we have boxed in the "Dining hall", which is an area, the "Instant reservation", and two Time Slots. We'll explain them below.

⚠ Any change in Settings will be in force until next change. No automatic reset will apply.

The features included in this section are:

Managing Areas: The owner can activate or deactivate specific areas such as the Dining Hall. When an area is deactivated, online reservations for that area become unavailable. This is useful for times when an area is temporarily closed or reserved for a private event.

Managing Instant Reservations: The restaurant owner can choose whether to activate or deactivate instant reservations. When deactivated, reservations are not automatically confirmed and need to be manually confirmed by the owner.

Managing Time Slots: The application allows the owner to activate or deactivate specific time slots to avoid overbooking, especially when reservations have been received via phone or email.

Managing Instant Reservations for Specific Time Slots: The restaurant owner can activate or deactivate instant reservations for individual time slots. When deactivated, reservations for that specific time slot need to be confirmed manually by the owner. Note, this feature is currently under development.

Texte alternatif

In terms of Opening Hours , they can be set not only generally, but also differently for various areas of the restaurant. For example, the restaurant terrace might be open only at lunchtime, while a lounge bar is open in the evening. The restaurant owner can also easily activate or deactivate operating days. Or, you might choose to deactivate Mondays and activate Tuesdays, with the relevant opening hours displayed.

To set up time slots for opening hours, click on the right arrow navigation key, next to the chosen day.

Texte alternatif

Starting and closing hours and minutes can be set for each day.

⚠ The system does not automatically sort the time slots in chronological order. If the slots are not arranged properly, they will appear disorganized on the website as well. You can add new time slots by clicking on "Add time slots", and remove them by clicking on the red bin icon next to a specific time slot.

Texte alternatif

If there's a need for more time slots, the restaurant owner can easily add new ones by clicking on "Add time slots." Similarly, if a specific time slot is no longer needed, it can be removed by clicking on the red bin symbol in the line of that particular time slot.

It's important to remember that any changes made must be saved, or they will not be taken into account. Without saving, the modifications will not reflect on the website or in the system. This ensures that the restaurant owner has full control over their reservation settings.

Opening Hours
Setting or changing the opening hours for your restaurant is a straightforward process on the MenuChic Manager app.

Texte alternatif

To begin, click on the arrow to the right of the "Opening Hours" menu item. This will take you to a screen where you can see the current opening hours for each day of the week.

Texte alternatif

Next to each day, there is a toggle button that you can activate or deactivate to open or close your restaurant on that specific day of the week. Simply click the button to change its status.

⚠ Please note that when you activate or deactivate a day, this change will apply to every subsequent week until you change it again. So if you choose to close on Mondays, for example, your restaurant will be marked as closed every Monday in the future until you manually change this setting.

Remember to review these settings regularly to ensure they align with your restaurant's actual operating hours, especially if there are changes due to holidays or special events.

Unforseen Closures
The MenuChic platform allows you to handle unforeseen closures of your restaurant due to events like strikes, natural disasters, illness, or any other unexpected situations. This affects all services, such as reservations and click & collect.

Texte alternatif

You can access the parameters for “Unforeseen closures”, by clicking on the arrow to the right of the "Unforeseen closures" line.

Texte alternatif

To create a new unexpected closure entry, click on the "Add New" button.

Texte alternatif

For closures that span entire days, enable the "All Day" toggle and then set the beginning and end dates. You can pick the desired dates by clicking the arrow icon next to the start and end date fields.

Texte alternatif

Select the appropriate date, and then confirm your choice by clicking "Choose".

⚠ The order of dates differs from country to country. In English, we start with the month, then the day and finally the year. In countries where the day comes first, followed by the month and year, this can pose a problem when the start date of a closing is the last day of a month. As the start date cannot be later than the end date, the month of the end date must be defined first, followed by the day and then the year.

Texte alternatif

Remember to save your changes.

Texte alternatif

Your newly configured unexpected closures will appear in the settings menu. You can edit or delete these entries whenever needed by clicking the right arrow next to the listed closure.

Texte alternatif

Here, you can set up, modify and save, or delete an exceptional closure.

If you opt to delete a closure, a confirmation prompt will appear.

Texte alternatif

By approving this prompt (“Delete it”), the selected closure will be deleted from your settings, and the regular functioning of reservations and click & collect will be restored.

Texte alternatif

If you need to close for specific hours instead of full days, you can deactivate the "All Day" button. This allows you to set precise hours and minutes for your closure.

Texte alternatif

To define the time range, click the arrow icon next to the respective start and end time fields. Choose the exact date, time, and minutes. Save these settings to apply the changes.

Texte alternatif

You can also opt to inform your customers about any unexpected closures by enabling a banner at the top of your website. To do so, activate the "Display on each page" option and save your settings.

Specialty foods
The Specialty Foods setting in the MenuChic Manager app is designed to help you feature the distinct offerings of your restaurant. This can range from region-specific cuisines to signature menu items, or even cater to dietary preferences like vegan or kosher options.

Texte alternatif

To access the food specialities parameters, click on the arrow to the right of the "Food specialities" line.

Texte alternatif

In this section, you can add or remove the specialties your restaurant is known for. These might include specific regional cuisines, certain types of dishes, or particular dietary options.

The specialities you have chosen will be displayed in the form of icons, either on the "Information" page of your restaurant's website,

Texte alternatif

or in a dedicated section on the homepage.

Keep inmind, the specialties you select will be prominently displayed on your website, aiding potential customers in understanding your offerings and deciding whether your restaurant aligns with their tastes.

⚠ Please referto the application for a visual guide on managing the Specialty Foods setting.

Services
Services refer to the amenities or facilities that your restaurant provides to its customers. These can include baby and child-friendly accommodations, restroom facilities, WiFi, music, television, parking, and more.

Texte alternatif

To access the settings of services, click on the right arrow navigation button in the Settings menu.

Texte alternatif

The services relevant to your restaurant can be easily activated within the Services settings of MenuChic. You'll see a list of various amenities and facilities. Next to each of these services, there's a toggle button. Simply click on the button to the right of the service you wish to activate.

These details will be displayed on your restaurant's website, providing potential customers with a clearer understanding of the amenities you offer.

Payment methods
Payment methods represent the various forms of payment your restaurant accepts, such as cash, credit/debit cards, digital

wallets, etc. Accurately representing your accepted payment methods can help avoid confusion and improve the customer experience.

Texte alternatif

To access the settings of payment methods, click on the right arrow navigation button in the Settings menu.

Texte alternatif

This will present you with a list of potential payment methods, including cash, credit cards, electronic transfers, digital wallets, and more. To activate a specific payment method, simply toggle the button next to it.

The payment methods you choose to activate will be those that your customers can use both at your restaurant and when ordering online. This information will be displayed on your restaurant's website, providing customers with clarity on how they can pay for their meals.

Don't forget to save any changes you make to ensure your customers have the most accurate information when choosing how to pay.

Application language
In MenuChic, the language of the application and that of your restaurant's website can be set differently according to your specific needs.

The language of the application refers to the language through which you and your staff interact with the software. This can be crucial for ease of use, especially in multi-lingual teams. For instance, in a Japanese restaurant in Paris, the restaurant owner and the waitstaff might be fluent in French, but the kitchen staff, being native Japanese speakers, may not.

Therefore, setting the application's language to Japanese can facilitate efficient communication and workflow within the restaurant. Additionally, the ticket printing in the kitchen can be configured to be in Japanese as well (please refer to printer settings (7.14) below).

Texte alternatif

To access the settings of the language app, click on the right arrow navigation button in the general section of the Settings menu.

Texte alternatif

A dropdown menu of available languages will appear. Select your desired language.

Please note that we are continually working on increasing the number of available languages.

⚠ While some of the translations have been approved by native translators, others have been translated using Google Translate. We strive to provide an excellent user experience, and we value our customers' feedback. If you find any inconsistencies or have suggestions for improvements in any language, please do not hesitate to send us your comments at support@menuchic.com.

Enable notifications
Enabling notifications in the MenuChic Manager application ensures you're always informed and can respond promptly to messages, orders, or reservations. Quick responses boost your customers' confidence and give them assurance that their message, order, or reservation has been acknowledged and will be dealt with efficiently.

Texte alternatif

To enable notifications, click on the toggle in the General section of the Settings menu.

⚠ Please note that enabling notifications in the application may not be enough. You might also need to allow MenuChic Manager to send notifications in your device's settings. You can usually find this under Settings > Notifications or Settings > Applications > Notifications, depending on your device.

⚠ Remember, if your device is set to vibrate or mute, you won't hear any sound when a notification arrives.

⚠ If you've done all of the above and still aren't receiving notifications, please check your internet connection. If everything seems in order and the issue persists, contact our support team at support@menuchic.com.

When notifications are activated, the small key icon in the application menu will turn green.

Texte alternatif

When notifications are disabled, it turns red.

This is how a notification looks like:

Texte alternatif

When a new notification arrives, you'll see a pop-up in the top right corner of the application.

This notification will disappear after a few seconds, but a small red circle will then appear in the relevant menu, indicating the number of unread messages, orders, or reservations. You can find this unread count in several places — on the homepage, in the quick menu on the right side of the application, and also in the burger menu.

Printer
Setting up a printer with the MenuChic Manager application can facilitate the printing of various types of tickets. This is useful for order management and can also enhance the organization within different areas of your restaurant. It's important to note that you can set up multiple printers as needed.

⚠ In order to connect a printer to the application, the printer must be:

● From the Epson TM-m30 Series (Refer to EPSON's Support Technical Reference Guide,,User’s Manual, Setup Guide & Installation Guide for more information).

● Connected to the same internet network as the MenuChic Manager application.

● Connected via an RJ45 Ethernet cable (Wireless or Bluetooth

connections are not supported).

Printer Installation
● Connect the printer to a power source using its power cable.

● Connect an Ethernet cable to the printer's Ethernet port and plug the other end of the RJ45 Ethernet cable into your router.

● Switch on the printer (A blue light should appear on the front/top of the printer).

● A test slip should print automatically. Please note down the IP address and SSID (network) details from this slip. You'll need these for setting up the printer in the application.

Texte alternatif

After entering the correct IP address and seeing the green checkmark confirmation, you can activate the printer by sliding the printer button to the right (it will turn green).

Texte alternatif

You can adjust the font size for your printed tickets to meet your preferences. After setting the font size, click on "Test". If the setup is successful, a small ticket labeled "MenuChic Manager" will be printed.

With this setup, your restaurant's order management process can be greatly enhanced. The ability to print order tickets directly from the application allows for easier communication and coordination between front-of-house staff and the kitchen.

Area settings
The "Area" setting allows you to configure the different sections in your restaurant where customers are served. This includes dining halls, terraces, lounge bars for table reservations, and pickup counters for takeaway orders. This feature also extends to areas where tableside ordering is available.

Texte alternatif

.

Click on the navigation arrow located to the far right of the "Area" setting. This will open up the available areas that have been pre-defined in the Back Office by the MenuChic Support team.

Texte alternatif

By clicking on the desired area, a small blue checkmark will appear indicating the area has been selected. You can select multiple areas as per your requirements.

Once you've selected all the areas you want to enable, remember to click 'Save' to ensure your changes are preserved. If you skip this step, your modifications won't be saved.

Texte alternatif

The chosen area(s) will then appear under the "Areas" section in the MenuChic Manager Application.

This function allows for better organization and streamlined operations, enhancing both the customer experience and operational efficiency. By defining specific areas, you can ensure that orders and reservations are directed to the right place, avoiding any confusion or mix-ups.

Order ticket settings
Order ticket setting allows the restaurant staff to have a printed copy of the customer's order, which aids in streamlining operations, reducing errors, and improving customer service. This can be particularly useful for takeaway or tableside orders.

Texte alternatif

To enable order ticket printing, click on the small arrow located to the far right of the 'Order ticket' setting in printing settings.

Texte alternatif

By default, the ticket printing feature is not activated. You can determine how many tickets will be printed per order by clicking on the plus button. The number can be set up to a maximum of three copies.

Texte alternatif

Texte alternatif

You can also choose the language in which the ticket will be printed. To do this, click on the default language (in this case, English).

Texte alternatif

A dropdown menu will then present you with a list of languages to choose from. Make sure to select the language that is most commonly understood by your staff, as the tickets are primarily for their use.

Texte alternatif

⚠ Important: The order tickets are intended for your staff, so the language selected should beone that your staffmembers are comfortable with.

Texte alternatif

Once you've made these selections, the number of tickets and their language will be displayed in the 'Order' section within the MenuChic Manager Application.

Customized ticket printing settings, fitting your staff's requirements,

can significantly improve operational efficiency and minimize any risk of

confusion or miscommunication in the kitchen.

Payment ticket setting up
Payment tickets are receipts provided to the customer after they've made a payment for their order. These tickets are important for maintaining a transparent transaction record with the customers.

Texte alternatif

To enable the printing of payment (and other) tickets, you have to follow steps very similar to (if not completely identical with) “Order Ticket Settings” above (see 7.14.4), so we will just summarize them:

1.Click on the small arrow located to the far right of the 'Payment ticket' setting.

2.This will open up the configuration settings for the payment tickets.

3.Just as in the case of 'Order ticket' setting (above), you can set the number of payment tickets to be printed for each transaction. Click on the plus button to increase the number. You can print up to a maximum of three tickets per transaction.

4.You also have the option to select the language in which the ticket will be printed. Click on the default language to open up a list of available languages.

⚠ Keep in mind: Payment tickets are intended to your customers. Be sure toselect a language that your customers can understand. Typically, this wouldbe the primary language ofthe country in which your restaurant is located..

5.Once you have selected the desired language, click 'Save' to ensure your changes are applied.

6.The selected number of tickets and their language will then be displayed under the 'Payment' section in the MenuChic Manager Application.

As you can see, the settings for payment tickets can be different from those for order tickets. This allows for more customization and better communication with your customers.

⚠ Due to legal invoice obligations, make sure to manually record payments in your cash register, even if you use the MenuChic Manager Application for printing payment tickets.

⚠ Every time the printer is rebooted or restarted, the IP address changes. So if the printer isn't working, the first thing to do is check the IP address.

Preparation ticket setting up
Setting up the preparation tickets for your restaurant can be a crucial step for improving efficiency in the kitchen and serving area. They are slightly different from the above ones, here are the steps to set them up:

Texte alternatif

To enable preparation ticket printing (of takeaway or tableside orders), click on the right arrow.

Texte alternatif

The number of tickets printed for each order can be set here. You can increase this number by clicking on the plus button, similar to the 'Order ticket' setting (same steps as in 7.14.4.)

Texte alternatif

The Preparation Tickets come in two models - PR1 and PR2.

Texte alternatif

You can switch between these models by simply clicking on them.

⚠ PR1 (Printed Receipt) is the default setting and PR2 is currently under development. We recommend sticking to PR1 for now.

Texte alternatif

The language settings for preparation tickets function the same way as they dofor ordertickets (see 7.14.4).

⚠ It is important to select the language that is understood by your kitchen staff to improve efficiency.

Texte alternatif

After having set up the tickets printing, you may configure the areas where you desire to print them out. You will need to designate the 'production areas'—also referred to as 'stations' in the back office—where different types of food and beverages are prepared. To select the relevant production areas for your restaurant, click on them; a small blue checkmark will appear next to each selected area. Make sure to save your selections once you're done.

⚠ The production areas you can select from are:

● Pantry

● Cold kitchen

● Hot kitchen

● Oven

● Grill

● Dessert

● Bar

● Cellar

● Manager

● Indoor kitchen

● Open air kitchen

When a product is linked to a specific production area within the restaurant, its preparation ticket will be printed directly in that location. This allows for efficient allocation of tasks – such as assigning all drink orders to the bar, pizza orders to the oven, and wine selections to the cellar. This feature proves to be particularly useful in larger restaurants or those with multiple distinct production areas.

In the given example, the restaurant owner has opted for the preparation tickets for hot dishes to be printed in the hot kitchen area, streamlining the process and ensuring the right tasks reach the right sections.

Texte alternatif

Once these configurations are made, the chosen settings will be visible under the "Preparation" section in the application.

⚠ The preparation ticket printing settings is specifically designed to make kitchen operations smoother and more efficient.

Reservation ticket settings
The process of configuring reservation tickets is identical to that of setting up order ticket printing (see 7.14.4). So you have to follow the same steps as outlined in section 7.14.4.

Texte alternatif

Your selected options will appear under the "Reservation" menu. As demonstrated in the example above, the configurations for reservation tickets can differ significantly from those of order tickets or other tickets.

Waiter ticket settings
Waiter ticket settings follow the same procedure as the order ticket printing setup, as detailed in section 7.14.4.

Texte alternatif

You can specify the number of tickets to print and choose the language. Your chosen options will be displayed under the "Waiter" menu. As depicted in the example above, the configurations for waiter tickets can vary significantly from those of order tickets or other types of tickets.

⚠ The waiter ticket is intended to be printed when a customer at a table selects the "Request a waiter" option.

Configuring the contact ticket is identical to setting up order ticket printing, as described in section 7.14.4. You can determine the number of tickets to be printed and set the language for the tickets. The selected options will appear under the "Contacts" menu. As can be seen in the image above, the configurations for contact tickets can differ greatly from those of order tickets or other tickets.

Testing Ticket printings
Testing Ticket Printings

To ensure that all your ticket configurations are set up correctly, it's essential to run a series of tests. Tickets that have been configured in the printer settings, and for which at least one paper ticket is enabled, will automatically print.

⚠ To enable ticket printing through the Application, make sure that notifications are activated. For details on this, refer to section 7.13.

Testing Procedure:

Make a test reservation.

Place test orders for takeaway and tableside service.

Send a contact message through the app.

⚠ This is also an excellent opportunity to test all functionalities. You should ensure that you receive:

notifications,

reservations, takeaway and tableside orders,

messages in the application, and

email confirmations,

while acting both in the role of the restaurant owner and the customer.

Troubleshooting:

If you face any issues, first review your settings as outlined in this manual.

Consult the FAQs for additional guidance.

Manage Reservations
When you select a reservation on the left-hand list, it will be highlighted in light blue (1). On the right side of the screen, you'll see a detailed frame containing all information relative to that reservation along with options to manage it (2).

Additional features in the navigation bar include: Accessing more information aboutthe customer. Initiating a chat with the customer. Reviewing their past reservations and orders.(1). Directly calling or sending an email to the customer for further queries. (2).

You can change reservation status.

These are reservation status options among which you can choose, if it is manual. Here, the reservation is received as “Merchant confirmation required”, which was previously set up in the back office, but it can be set up as “confirmed” upon you.

The reservation status management can operate in three modes:

● Fully Manual: Each reservation needs to be managed individually;

● Semi-Automatic: Manual confirmation required only if a customer has left a comment orspecial request;

● Fully Automatic: In the back office, you set upthe time interval after which reservations are automatically marked as "Completed."

⚠ If the reservation management is set to be fully automatic, reservations will disappear from the "Reservations" list once the date and time have passed. For manual modes, the reservation will remain in the list until its status is updated to one of the following: "Placed," "Canceled," "No-Show," "Impossible," or "Abandoned."

⚠ Customers will receive an email notification confirming the status of their reservation, whether it's validated or canceled.

Complete all the necessary fields, on behalf of the customer.

Cash register
A cash register is an essential tool for recording and managing sales transactions within your business.

⚠ This section is currently under development and will be available soon.

Tables (a server takes orders)
The "Tables" function allows waiters to place customers at designated, numbered tables and manage tableside orders.

Placing customers
The maximum number of guests per table is pre-configured in the back office.

Upon seating guests, the waiter enters the number of guests at the table, which then opens a digital menu for the waiter to add selected food and beverages.

Then opens a digital menu in which the waiter can add the chosen plates and drinks to the table.

Digital tableside Order Taking
One of the most important tasks of waiters is taking orders. In a busy place, it makes a difference how quickly orders are taken and served. The order register paper block has been the most important tool for waiters for decades, but with the digital order-taking menu, and a touchscreen tablet, efficiency in the restaurant can be multiplied. With the digital order-taking menu, you can take a guest's order at the table in an instant, via phone or tablet.

● Tap a menu item multiple times to match the number of times it has been ordered. You can also adjust the quantity on the right-hand side by clicking on the arrow beneath the respective product.

● If the menu is extensive and not all items are visible, you can use the quick search function located in the top left-hand corner to add items.

● On the top right corner of the screen, essential information is displayed, such as the number of products ordered, the table occupancy time in minutes, and the total amount due.

● Assign the table to a guest already registered in the system by clicking the blue "person+" button.

● Modify the number of guests at the table by using the blue button next to the table number.

● Clear the table once customers have finished their meals and left by clicking the "Free table" button.

● Reset the order form entirely by clicking "Discard".

● Initiate the preparation of the order in the kitchen by clicking "Send to production". The ordered items will be prepared and then served to the customers' table.

● Charge the customer for the meal.

__

⚠ When the order is taken by a staff member in the application on behalf of the customer, the order is assigned to the waiter (name).

While customers are seated and eating their meal, the waiter can still

● Edit the number of guests (use the edit button under the table number).

● Add additional orders to the table.

● Free up the table once it's no longer occupied.

● Monitor payment status.

● Facilitate the payment process for the guests.

The different colors in the tables mean different things:

● Blue : Order placed via the Application by a waiter at table 1 on behalf of the customers, they are seated at the table and are waiting for or eating the food.

● Red : Customers have ordered via the QR code at their table (2) and have clicked on the "Waiter requested" button. One of the staff must therefore go and help them.

● Green : Customers have ordered via the QR code at their table (12) and have clicked on the "Invoice requested" button.

● Gray : Customers have ordered via the QR code at their table (201), they are seated at the table and are waiting for or eating the food.

● Blac k: The table is free.

Make a Tableside Order Paid
When customers are ready to make their payment, the server clicks on the green "Pay" button to proceed. At this point, a selection of pre-configured payment methods (as outlined in Payment methods, section 7.11) will become available.

In case of cash payments, the server must input the exact amount

received from the customer and then confirm by clicking the green

tick mark.

⚠ For all other payment methods, like credit/debit cards, restaurant vouchers, and cheques, it's not necessary to enter the specific amount received. The system will automatically mark these as "paid." This is because the MenuChic Manager Application is not a POS system. For French users, note that the value of luncheon vouchers cannot be entered. Next to the "paid" payment status, the method used for payment will be displayed and considered in the statistics.

Once the payment status updates to "paid," all other functionalities, except for the green "Pay" button, will still be accessible. These include:

● Changing the number of guests;

● Adding a new order (at which point the green "Pay" button will reappear);

● Clearing the table.

⚠ After payment, at the counter via the app or via mobile, the table is automatically cleared. No need to clear it manually.

Finally, the tableside orders will appear automatically in the “Orders”, see next section below (8.6 Orders).

Orders
The "Orders" section, accessible from the homepage, serves as a centralized hub where you can view and manage all types of orders:

1.Tableside orders added manually by the server (refer to section

8.5 above for details).

2.Tableside orders received via a QR code menu located on each table.

3.Takeaway orders.

On the left-hand side of the screen, in ascending order of date, you can find all the orders from today to the most distant ones. By clicking on each one, you can obtain detailed information about a specific order. The small red credit card means that the order has not yet been paid for. Here you have: You have the essential information:

● table number or order name,

● order status, payment status, and

● order number.

In this list we can see:

1.a tableside order added manually by the server (see 8.5 above),

2.a takeaway order effectuated on your website by a customer, Martha Gruber,

3.a tableside order received from a customer using a unique Menu QR code associated to table No.15, where he has been placed.

⚠ There is no distinction between a tableside order effectuated manually by the waiter, or by the customer by scanning and ordering via menu QR code. The important is

● The order status: this informs y-you about the status of the order, is validated, under preparation, distributed, etc., and

● The payment status: it has been paid or not.

Managing Orders
As with "reservations",

1.on the left you have a list of current and future orders (when they are to be served or distributed), in ascending date order.

2.Once you've clicked on a specific order, you'll find all the essential information on the right: its order and payment status.

3.At the top, you can send a mail or phone the customer with a simple click, if you need specific information about the order.

4.The navigation bar allows you to toggle between contact details, previous chat, booking and orders, if you need to consult the customer's history.

If order status management is set to "manual," or is automatic but requires manual intervention due to a customer comment, you will need to manually update the order status.

__

● Received: This status is an automatic acknowledgment that the order has been received in the system.

● Validated: This means the order is confirmed and you can proceed with preparation and distribution.

● Canceled: The order has been canceled for specific reasons.

● Distributed: The order has been served or handed over to the customer.

● Abandoned: The customer did not pick up the order or changed their mind after placing it at the table.

⚠ For takeaway orders, customers will be notified if their order is either "validated" or "canceled".

⚠ If the order status management is set to automatic, the order will automatically be removed from the list once the date and time for the order has passed. If managed manually, the order will stay on the list until its status is manually updated as "distributed," "canceled," or "abandoned."

⚠ Once an online order has been placed by a customer, it cannot be altered. The restaurant owner can cancel the order and request the customer to submit a new one.

Make an Order Paid
See 8.5.3 above.

Creating New Orders
There are two scenarios in which a restaurant owner might need to place a takeaway order on behalf of a customer: when the customer is present and when the customer is not present.

● Customer Not Present: This happens when a customer cannot access the internet and opts to call the restaurant or send an email (or message via the contact form) to have an order placed on their behalf.

● Customer Present: This refers to someone who comes into the restaurant and requests that a takeaway order be made in their name for a future date, such as for a birthday cake. In both scenarios, the restaurant owner will place the order on behalf of the customer.

⚠ If the customer has not been recorded in the system, you must first create an account on their behalf before placing the order. See section 8.1.1 for details.

To create a takeaway order for a customer, click on the "plus" button situated in the upper left corner of the screen.

Select the following fields to proceed with the order:

● pickup date,

● pickup time (hourand minutes),

● guest who is the owner of the order (not mandatory, you can leave it out and place an order without registered guest)

You have to search for the guest and add it, if you place an order on behalf of a registered guest.

Then save it.

1.Add the requested items following the procedure outlined in section 8.5.2.

2.In the case of a present customer, proceed with payment as detailed in section 8.5.3.

3.In the case of a non-present customer, click on “Send to production.” Payment will be collected at the time of pickup, also as described in section 8.5.3.

__

When a dish has options, after clicking on the plate, the option window pops up.

If an option has a price, it will be added to the basic cost of the dish.

The order will automatically appear in the list of products to be prepared. Manage its status as outlined in section 8.6.1. To mark it as paid, follow the guidelines in section 8.5.3.

Order History
Click on "Order History" to quickly review your orders by:

● Order status

● Payment status.

Only days on which you have received orders are active. By selecting a specific date and clicking "View Orders," you can view all orders received on that specific day.

Once a date has been selected, you can further filter the orders by:

1.Order status,

2.Payment status.

By selecting the order status, a list of orders for the chosen day will appear.

By selecting the payment status, a list of orders for the chosen day will also appear.

⚠ You have the option to cross-filter both order and payment status. For instance, if you select "Distributed" under order status and "To be paid" under payment status, you can verify that all distributed orders are still awaiting payment.

⚠ If no results appear (nothing to display), it's likely you'll need to adjust one of your filter settings, most likely the order status.

Catalog
The Catalog serves as the backbone of your sales activities, offering a blend of application and back office functionalities. Note that some alterations will require you to access the Back Office, to which you'll be redirected accordingly.

By clicking on the Catalog you can access your global product management.

Within the Application, you can manage:

● Menus

● Products

● Ingredients

● Options

● Inventory

● Prices

Via the Back Office, you can modify and create:

● Ingredients,

● Products

Here is a schema about the structure and the layout of a menu, with its elements in due order:

Menu

1.1. Category

1.1.1. Product

1.1.1.1. Ingredients (included and added)

1.1.1.2. Removable added ingredients (optional)

1.1.1.3. Option:

1.1.1.3.1. Product

1.1.1.3.2. Ingredient

1.1.1.3.3. Free text

Menu: is the digital version of your Restaurant Menu containing the elements below.

Category: Groups together products based on common culinary traits like timing (starter, main course, dessert) or type (solid, liquid). Examples include "Starters," "Main Courses," "Desserts," etc.

Product: A specific dish or item made from one or multiple processed or prepared ingredients. Examples include "Fish & Chips," "Hamburger," "Tiramisu”,, “Apple pie”, “Coca-cola”, “Burgundy”, “Whisky”, etc.

Ingredient: The raw materials for each product. They can be (1) included, essential and inseparable, like cream in ice cream, and (2) added, optional and separable, like toppings on ice cream.

Option: Choices within a product, menu, or category. They can be

(1) product-based, choosing between two main courses in a set menu,

(2) ingredient-based, optional extras in a product, like bacon in a burger, and

(3) free text, choices that don't fit into other categories, like serving an ice cream in a cone or a jar.

⚠ You can edit all elements but can create only products and added ingredients. You can also add ingredients to existing products.

⚠ Categories and menus must be initially set up by our support team at support@menuchic.com. Similarly, options and their elements cannot be created or edited by you.

Managing Menus
By clicking on "Menus," you enter the menu management interface.

Your only available action here is to enable or disable specific menus. This is done by toggling the switch located to the right of the respective menu.

Managing, Editing and Creating Added
Ingredients
Click on "Ingredients" to access the management of added ingredients.

Managing Added Ingredients
In the ingredient list, you can set an ingredient as either "hidden" or "out of stock." This status is displayed beneath the name of the specific ingredient in the ingredient list.

To set an ingredient as 'hidden' or 'out of stock,' click the small arrow icon located to the right of the particular ingredient.

Hiding ingredients
To hide an ingredient, activate the "Hidden" button. As a result:

● all products containing this ingredient will be removed from the menu;

● The ingredient will also be removed from any options that include it, making it unavailable for customer selection. To unhide an ingredient deactivate the "Hidden" button. As a result:.

● all products containing this ingredient will be reinstated in the menu;

● The ingredient will be reinstated in options where it is included, making it selectable for customers once again.

⚠ This action is not automated. Ifan ingredient is nolonger meantto be hidden, you must manually change its status to make it available on the menu again.

⚠ Why Hide an Ingredient?

● The primary reason to hide an ingredient (and by extension, any product containing it) is that it is either no longer in use or won't be supplied for an extended period.

● You may use seasonal ingredients and change your menu with each season.

● The advantage of hiding an ingredient is that it will always remain in your ingredients directory, so you can remove and restore it at any time.

Ingredient out of stock
When an ingredient is set as 'out of stock,' it will impact your menu and options in the following ways:

● Products containing the out-of-stock ingredient will be marked as 'unavailable.'

● The ingredient will not be selectable in any options where it's included.

By default, setting aningredient to 'out of stock' is indefinite, meaning you must manually remove the "out of stock" status once the ingredient is available again. However, you have options to specify the expected restock date.

By clicking on it, you can set up the provision date of the ingredient.

You can opt for one of two settings for the provision date:

● "Undefined Date”: Choose this if you're unsure when the ingredient will be restocked. You'll need to manually make the ingredient available again once it's back in stock.

● “Pick a date”: Here, you can specify the exact date and time you expect to receive the ingredient.

To set a specific date and time:

● Select the date and time from the available options.

● Click "Choose."

Upon doingthis, the system will automatically set all affected products and options to 'unavailable.' They will be set back to 'available' at the specified date and time once the ingredient is restocked.

Editing Added Ingredients
When you wish to edit added ingredients, you'll need to navigate to the Back Office rather than making changes within the application itself. Here's how you can do it:

Redirect to Back Office:

● Click on the "Edit ingredients" option.

● You'll be automatically redirected to the Back Office. The redirection time may vary depending on your internet speed.

First connection to the Back Office
⚠ If you're logging into the Back Office for the first time, you might be prompted to enter your login credentials. These will be the same as those you use for the application.

Troubleshooting

⚠ Should you encounter any difficulties while trying to edit, you can attempt to resolve the issue by closing and reopening the application twice.

⚠ If problems persist after multiple attempts, reach out to Menuchic support at support@menuchic.com for further assistance.

General Data
When you are redirected to the Back Office, you'll land on the ingredient form, which allows you to make various changes.

In the ‘Info’ section, you have a list of data fields to fill out:

● Name: The name ofthe ingredient.

● Description: A description of the ingredient that will bevisible on the website.

● Internal Description: This is information for internal use only and can be accessed within the Back Office.

The description is visible on the website. The internal description is only personal information about the ingredients that can be consulted in the back office.

Translation Tool
How to Use? Click on the little red flag: This will open the translation window.

Languages: Your website's main language will be the source for all other translations. Languages that are set to "automatic" will utilize Google Translate.

Empty or Incorrect Translations: If the translations are not up to your standard or are incorrect, click on "Translate again."

Update: Make sure to click "Update" to save the changes.

Manual Editing: If you are not satisfied with the translations, you can manually edit them. When you do, the "automatic" setting will be deactivated to ensure your manual translation is not overwritten by Google Translate. Don't forget to click "Update" to save these manual translations.

⚠ Translation is an important aspect of user experience, especially if your website caters to a multilingual audience. Therefore, we recommend checking the translations carefully to make sure they accurately represent the ingredients and any other information.

The translation window appears. The main language is the main language of your website and the source language from which Google Translate translates into other languages. Those languages in which the texts are translated by Google Translate, are activated as “automatic”.

If the translation fields are empty, or you are not happy with translation, click on “Translate again’. Don't forget to click on "Update" when you're finished.

If you are still not satisfied with Google Translate translation, you can edit the text directly in the translation field, and write what you want. In this case, the "automatic" button will be automatically deactivated to prevent your translation from being overwritten by Google Translate. Don't forget to click on "Update" when you're finished.

Adding Images
Click on to the image tab.

Click on the “Drag and drop files here, or click to select files” and select the way you want to add a picture:

● Open Photo Library and select and image,

● Take a picture with you camera,

● Choose a File from your repertory.

Select the image you want to add to the ingredient, and open it.

Click on “Start upload”.

Once you've uploaded an image, look out for the confirmation message "Successfully updated.". Post-upload, the image will appear in a designated line within the interface. From here, you can remove the image at any time by selecting the "Delete" option.

⚠ The "Product Page" and "List" checkboxes are automatically selected by default. This feature ensures that the image is visible whenever the ingredient is part of a product option.

⚠ You have the flexibility to upload multiple images for a single ingredient. These will be displayed as a carousel on the product page, allowing customers to swipe through different visuals.

⚠ For the best performance and display quality, we recommend uploading images with dimensions of 700 x 500 pixels and a file size between 100-400 Kb. To maintain a consistent visual effect, use the same type of image (portrait or landscape), the same size and the same background for each product.

Example: Pineapple as a topping option for tapioca.

On the Tapioca product page, customers are presented with topping options, including pineapple. Selecting 'pineapple' will trigger a pop-up window displaying the ingredient's image. Customers can confirm their choice by clicking "OK."

Ingredient management
The Back Office features toggle switches for ingredient management that parallel the application's functionality, excluding the ability to set a restocking date. You'll generally find two main options:

Listed: By toggling "Listed" on, the ingredient becomes visible on your website under products that include it. This function caters to customers interested in the composition of their meals.

Detailed: The "Detailed" switch, when used in conjunction with "Listed," provides extensive information about the ingredient, such as its characteristics, whether it's an add-on or included by default, and relevant dietary or allergen details. This detail is crucial for customers with dietary needs or allergies.

Example: Banana Split:

Let's say you offer a Banana Split dessert that includes:

● Banana,

● Strawberry Ice Cream,

● Chocolate Ice Cream,

● Vanilla Ice Cream,

● Chocolate Coulis.

In this example, the banana might only be "Listed" because it's a straightforward, single ingredient. On the other hand, the ice creams could be both "Listed" and "Detailed" because they are homemade and contain milk—important information for customers who value quality and/or have lactose sensitivities. Finally, the whipped cream could also be "Listed" and flagged as removable for customers who might want to skip it.

Quality Message: Letting customers know that ingredients are homemade can be a selling point and adds a layer of quality assurance to your offerings.

Dietary Restrictions: Indicating that an ingredient contains potential allergens like dairy is not just good practice—it's often legally required and always appreciated by customers with dietary restrictions.

⚠ Essential Pre-Configuration: Before adding a new product, it is crucial to precisely configure its ingredients to ensure that all relevant information is readily available to your customers. This helps in making an informed choice, enhancing customer satisfaction and compliance with food labeling regulations.

Purchase management (under development)
This section is currently under development. As we strive to improve our services, you may encounter fields related to our upcoming stock management feature. These are not yet operational but are included to offer a glimpse into future functionalities. We appreciate your patience and support while we complete these updates.

Ingredient Related Data (origins, diet, content)
The final section to complete is on the bottom of the page.

Ingredient-Related Data (Origins, Diet, Content): The final section to complete is located at the bottom of the page. This area is crucial for detailing the type and quality of the ingredients used in your menu. Here's what each part of this section entails:

Raw and Not Processed ingredients: If the ingredient falls under this category (e.g., fruits, vegetables, eggs, natural dairy products, raw meat, and fish), there's no need to fill out additional fields for "added" and "included" ingredients, as they are self-explanatory.

Processed ingredients: For processed foundational ingredients like pizza dough or tomato sauces, which are made up of raw and unprocessed ingredients, this is where you fill in those details.

Attributes: The attributes are designed to indicate the quality of the ingredient. This could be information on how the ingredient was grown, its origins, or other quality markers.

Diet: Here you can specify dietary categorizations (such as vegetarian, vegan, etc.) and also indicate any potential allergens the ingredient may contain like gluten, lactose, soya, peanuts, etc.

Both the 'Attributes' and the 'Diet' elements will be "detailed" under the ingredient on your website, providing your customers with comprehensive information about what they are consuming.

Filling out this section comprehensively ensures that customers have all the relevant details about each ingredient, thereby making a more informed dining choice.

Creating Added Ingredients
If you want to create a new added ingredient, click on the "plus" button.

You will be redirected to the page where you must name the new ingredient. If you want to create it quickly, just click on the "create" button.

The new ingredient will be added to the list of ingredients, which you can modify at any time as described above in the section 8.8.2.2. Editing Added Ingredients.

If, after naming your new added ingredient, you click on the "Create and edit" button, you will be redirected to the editing page..

If this is the case, follow the steps described above in section

8.8.2.2. Editing Added Ingredients.

Managing, Editing and Creating Added
Products
By clicking on the “Products” button you can manage, edit and create products.

Managing Products
Products can be managed in three ways:

Hidden: Hiding a product will remove it from visibility on your menu. Customers won't see or be able to order it.

Out of Stock: If a product is out of stock, it will be marked as such on the menu and will be unavailable for ordering.

Highlighted: When a product is highlighted, it will have a special designation indicating its prominence.

For details on how the "Hidden" and "Out of Stock" functionalities work, see section 8.8.2.1 “Managing Added Ingredients” above.

Featured products
When you activate “highlighted” option,

The "Highlighted" function serves a special purpose:

Visibility: A tag or indicator will appear under the name of the highlighted product.

Promotion: This feature can be used to promote best-sellers, house specialties, or limited-time offers.

⚠ The "Highlighted" feature will only be visible on your website if you've specifically requested a promotional block to be added via support@menuchic.com.

Utilizing the "Highlighted" function effectively allows you to draw attention to specific items, potentially boosting sales and enhancing the customer experience.

Editing Products
The process of editing a product is performed in the Back Office, which contains comprehensive tools and options for customization.

First connection to the Back Office
⚠ Products are edited in the Back Office, not in the application. You will be redirected to the Back Office, which may take a few seconds depending on your internet speed.

⚠ If it's your first time, you will need to log in. The login information is the same as what you use for the application.

⚠ Upon your first login, you might not directly land on the product page. If this occurs, simply close the summary page and click on "Edit product" again.

⚠ If you encounter any issues, try closing and reopening the application twice. If problems persist, reach out to support@menuchic.com.

⚠ The fields available for editing have been pre-configured by MenuChic's support team. If additional configurations are needed, contact support@menuchic.com.

General data
The process of editing product information is quite similar to that of editing ingredient data.

Name: This will be the name displayed on the product page. Short name: This is the name that will appear on the menu page. If left empty, the default will be the name entered in the "Name" field.

Description: A concise description of the product that appears on the menu page. Recipe: This is a more detailed description that appears on the individual product page. Video: If applicable, a video describing or showcasing the product can be uploaded and will be displayed on the product page. Reference: This field is for internal use only. If you have a specific product reference number, it can be entered here.

Translation tool
The small red flags symbolize that Google Translate may automatically handle the translation of your website content. The system is the same as the one described in the ingredient section (refer to section 8.8.2.2.3 for more details).

Adding Images
To upload an image, follow the same steps as in “Adding Images” in 8.8.2.2.4 section above.

The platform allows you to upload multiple images for each product:

● You can upload one or multiple images easily.

● You can choose which images you wish to display on the “Product Page”.

● Only one can be set as the "listed" image, which will then appear on the menu page.

Specific Settings
You can adjust your product's specific settings in several ways:

● Unique Product: Indicate if your product is one-of-a-kind and the only one available for sale. ● No Pick-up Delay: Choose this if your product is digital or to be sent by mail, requiring no physical pick-up.

● Immediate Check-out: Select this option if customers should be

directed straight to the checkout after adding this item to their cart.

● Force Payment at Checkout: Ensure that this product must be paid for during checkout. (Note: This requires STRIPE or PayPal integration; for more details, contact support@menuchic.com).

● Combo Product: Use this setting if your product comes with various options, like a choice between fries or salad in a hamburger meal.

Kitchen Stations: Setting up the station, or the area where the dish is prepared, is important if you've integrated a printer (see Section 7.14.6). You can specify whether the item is prepared in the cold kitchen, hot kitchen, or oven, for example.

Nutrition scores
Setting up the “station” is important if you have set up a printer (see 7.14.6 above).

The Nutri-Score serves as a guide to the nutritional quality of food items, grading them from A (highest quality) to E (lowest quality). While the use of Nutri-Score is not mandatory, it is encouraged by various governmental bodies and health organizations to assist consumers in making healthier food choices.

The score considers both positive and negative elements, such as:

● Positive: Amount of fruits, vegetables, fibers, proteins;

● Negative: Saturated fats, sugar.

To assign a Nutri-Score to your homemade dishes, you'll need to calculate the Nutritional Values. Determine the nutritional score for each dish based on its ingredients and their respective nutritional values per 100 g or 100 mL. Different categories of foods may require different calculation methods.

Use Online Calculators: Various online platforms can help you calculate the Nutri-Score. Some options include::

● Scan Up: https://scanup.fr/calculateur-nutri-score,

● Healthy Beat https://healthybeat.com/nutrition/recipe-calorie-calculator/,

● Very well Fit https://www.verywellfit.com/recipe-nutrition-analyzer-4157076

● Nutri-Score Calculator https://nutrirechner.xyz/.

⚠ The accuracy of these online calculators can vary, and they are intended solely for informational and educational purposes. Always double-check the ingredient labels and consult a qualified nutritionist for the most reliable and accurate information.

If you want to provide the most accurate nutritional information possible, you have the option of adding detailed data about the energy, calories, and other nutritional values (like fats, carbohydrates, protein, sodium, etc.) per 100g or 100 mL of each dish. Steps to Calculate Nutritional Values Ingredients and Quantities: First, compile a list of all ingredients and their respective quantities used in each dish. Online Tools for Analysis: Utilize online tools that can provide a nutritional breakdown based on your ingredients list. These tools often allow you to enter your list of ingredients and get a detailed report. So:

● Very well Fit https://www.verywellfit.com/recipe-nutrition-analyzer-4157076,

● Happy Forks https://happyforks.com/analyzer,

● One Ingredient Chef https://oneingredientchef.com/how-to-get-nutrition-facts/

● Whis khttps://samsungfood.com/recipe-nutrition-calculator/.

These tools will generate nutritional data such as the number of calories, the amounts of carbs, proteins, fats, sodium, and sugar per serving or per 100g/100mL of your dish.

⚠ It's important to note that these online tools are for informational and educational purposes only. They may not be 100% accurate or up-to-date. As such, you should always verify the labels of the ingredients you use and consider consulting a certified nutritionist for the most reliable and personalized advice.

Attached media links
You have the option to attach external HTML or PDF links to each product. These links will appear on the product page and can provide additional information about the product, such as its origin, preparation method, or any other relevant data.

Age restrictions
If you're selling products that have age restrictions, like alcoholic beverages, it's crucial to set up a minimum age requirement. This ensures that you're adhering to legal requirements and responsible business practices.

Product preparation time settings
How it Works

Preparation time is especially important for 'to-go' orders. The system uses the specified preparation time to calculate the nearest available pick-up time slot for the customer.

Example Let's assume you have a pick-up time slot every 30 minutes, and a particular product requires 20 minutes to prepare. If a customer places an order at 2:45 pm, although the next time slot is from 3:00 pm to 3:30 pm, the system will offer the following slot (3:30 pm to 4:00 pm) because the preparation time exceeds 15 minutes.

Product availability and displaying Management
The product availability and display options work in much the same way as described in section 8.8.3.1 "Managing Products." However, in this interface, you can also specify the position of a product if it is highlighted. The default setting for this is position 0.

Time Slot Settings
Once your opening hours and time slots have been configured by support@menuchic.com, you can select these settings from a list. This is particularly useful ifa product has a unique time slot different from the regular time slots.

Price Settings
You can set up different prices for tableside and takeaway orders, and also VAT rates.

Simple price means that the product has only one unit. For example you have only one fixed portion of Banana Split.

Once the support has set up a pricing, you can add it to a product. In the above-example, the Banana split has ti prices, small and big portions.

This is how it looks on the website.

This pricing system is very useful if you have different prices for different quantities of the same product. It can be a decimal measurement (liter, centiliter, gram, kilogram, etc.) or another

measurement (person, piece, scoop, plate, small, medium, large, etc.).

Product Related Data (origins, diet, content)
A product is generally composed of various elements such as added and included ingredients, options, dietary values, and allergens. All of this information can be set up in this section.

⚠ Please note that the concept of side dishes is heavily used in some countries, such as Italy. The feature to include side dishes is in development.

Product location and area settings
Defining where each product is available is vital for smooth operations and customer satisfaction. Products may be designated for specific areas like the lounge bar, wine cellar, dining room, or takeaway counter.

Setting the Area The specific areas where products can be served are predefined by MenuChic's support team. To add or modify areas, reach out to support@menuchic.com.

Example For instance, the Banana Split is available in the lobby, on the terraces, and at the takeaway counter. After setting the area, you can categorize the product under the appropriate menu category. In this case, Banana Split will show up in the "Desserts" category on both the dine-in and takeaway menus.

⚠ Always remember to update any changes you make to ensure they are reflected on the live menu.

Creating Products
To add a new product, click on the "plus" button located in the top left-hand corner of the screen.

This will open the product creation page where you can enter essential product information such as its name, description, and category.

The pricing for the new product can be set up as outlined in section 8.8.2.2.3.

You then have three options for registering the product:

Create : The product will be registered with the essential data you have provided.

Create and edit: You'll be redirected to the editing page for further customization (as described in section 8.8.3.2).

Create and duplicate: The product will be saved with the current data, and a new creation page will open with the same data, allowing for quick duplication. This is particularly useful when you have similar products with minor variations and you wish to populate the menu rapidly.

Managing Options
Options enhance the customization of a product by offering additional or alternative ingredients, flavors, or items. These could range from ice cream flavors and fixed-menu dishes to extra toppings and sauces.

To manage options, click on the “options button”.

Options are the products or ingredients, mandatory or additional, free or paying, that can be chosen for a specific product. They may be the flavors of three scoops of ice cream, dishes available on a fixed menu, or extras such as toppings and sauces.

The options available have been previously configured by the MenuChic support team. If you need additional options, reach out to support@menuchic.com for assistance.

Use the search bar to find the option by its name or scroll through the list. Once you find the desired option, click on the small arrow located to its right to manage it. Managing Individual Items within an Option Click on the small arrow next to the specific item within an option to manage its availability.

You have the flexibility to activate or deactivate options for specific menus. For instance, a "dine-in" menu might offer various customization options since cooking is done on-site. Conversely, for takeaway orders, you may opt not to offer such customization to simplify the process.

For example, you can offer options for a product in the "dine-in" menu, because you can take care of the cooking on site, but you can sell the product as a takeaway without offering options.

You can manage the items available for selection in the option by clicking on the small arrow for the item in question.

Hide: Choosing to hide an item will remove it from the list of selectable options for that particular product. Unhide: If an item becomes available again, you can reactivate it so that it shows up in the selection options.

⚠ Always remember to save any changes you make to ensure they are implemented.

By carefully managing the options associated with each product, you offer your customers the ability to tailor their order to their preferences, thereby enhancing their dining experience. At the same time, you maintain control over the complexity of orders, striking a balance between customization and operational efficiency.

Inventory Management
⚠ This section is still a work-in-progress, but it will be essential for managing your inventory levels once complete. Below is a sneak peek into how it is planned to work.

To get started with inventory management, click on the "Inventory" option, typically found in your management dashboard.

You will have the ability to locate specific products or ingredients using the "search" field. Alternatively, you can scroll through the list to find what you're looking for.

Once you identify the item of interest, click on it to open the inventory management window for that specific item.

Enter the number of units or the amount of the product or ingredient you have received from your supplier.

Make sure to click the 'Save' button to confirm and update the inventory levels for that item. By continually updating your inventory levels, you ensure that you have an accurate record, making it easier to manage orders and avoid any disruptions due to lack of stock.

Although this feature is still under development, its implementation will offer an organized and effective way to manage your stock levels, thereby contributing to smoother business operations in the future.

Price Management
⚠ The Price Management section is still in the development stage, but here's a glimpse into what it will entail once it's up and running.

To get started with price management, click on the "Price Management" option, which is likely to be available on your management dashboard.

You can locate specific products or ingredients using the "search" field or scroll through the list until you find what you're looking for.

Once you have located the desired item, click on it to open the price management window for that specific product or ingredient.

Add Supplier Price: Here, you'll be able to enter the price at which you've purchased the item from your supplier.

Save: Make sure to save the updated price. This information can be useful for analyzing costs and setting retail prices.

By keeping track of your purchase costs, you'll be better positioned to manage your pricing strategies effectively.

I cannot set up the ending date of the
exceptional closure
● The order of dates differs from country to country. In English, we start with the month, then the day and finally the year.

● In countries where the day comes first, followed by the month and year, this can pose a problem when the start date of a

closing is the last day of a month. As the start date cannot be later than the end date, the month of the end date must be defined first, followed by the day and then the year.

I see special characters on my website in
the text
● Sometimes the system does not handle certain characters, such as the apostrophe (') and inverted commas (".."). This happens mainly with texts automatically translated by Google Translate (See section Translation Tool).

● Go and edit the item in question (product, ingredient, etc.) and enter it manually.

We are always happy to receive suggestions for improvement or development, so please don't hesitate to contact us with your comments and ideas.
